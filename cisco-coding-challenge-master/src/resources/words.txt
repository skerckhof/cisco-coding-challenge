The Azores, officially the Autonomous Region of the Azores, is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal. It is an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean about 1,360 km west of continental Portugal,
about 1,643 km west of Lisbon, in continental Portugal, about 1,507 km northwest of Morocco, and about 1,925 km southeast of Newfoundland, Canada.

Its main industries are agriculture, dairy farming, livestock, fishing, and tourism, which is becoming the major service activity in the region. In addition, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly 
in the service and tertiary sectors. The main capital of the Azores is Ponta Delgada.

There are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are Flores and Corvo, to the west; Graciosa, Terceira, São Jorge, Pico, and Faial in the centre; and São Miguel, Santa Maria, and the Formigas Reef to the east. 
They extend for more than 600 km and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.
